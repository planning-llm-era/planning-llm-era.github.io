Over the past sixty years, the field of planning has made significant contributions to
both the theory and practice of building planning software that can solve previously
unaddressed planning problems. This was done through established practices of
rigorous design and evaluation of planning systems. The experience and expertise
of the planning community are not just important from a historical perspective;
the lessons learned could play a crucial role in accelerating the development of
LLM-based planners. The purpose of this tutorial is to share the knowledge with
the wider AI community, with the aim of incorporating the insights, tools, and
data from the automated planning community into the design and evaluation of
LLM-based planners.
