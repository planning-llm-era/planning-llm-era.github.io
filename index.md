For over six decades, the field of automated planning has been at the heart of AI, empowering intelligent systems to reason, act, and achieve goals in complex, dynamic environments. From robotics and logistics to space exploration, planning research has fueled autonomous decision-making in real-world applications.

Today, as large language models redefine what’s possible in AI, the principles and methodologies of planning are more vital than ever. The planning community brings decades of experience in designing, benchmarking, and interpreting intelligent behavior; expertise that can accelerate the development of powerful, trustworthy, and general-purpose LLM-based agents.

Participants will gain a clear understanding of what planning truly entails, what has been learned (and sometimes forgotten) in the shift toward LLM-based approaches, and how foundational insights from the planning community can inform the creation of stronger, more reliable, and more scalable LLM-powered planners.

Noam Brown is a research scientist at OpenAI investigating reasoning and multi-agent AI. He co-created Libratus and Pluribus, the first AIs to defeat top humans in two-player no-limit poker and multiplayer no-limit poker, respectively, and Cicero, the first AI to achieve human-level performance in the natural language strategy game Diplomacy. He has received the Marvin Minsky Medal for Outstanding Achievements in AI, was named one of MIT Tech Review's 35 Innovators Under 35, and his work on Pluribus was named by Science as one of the top 10 scientific breakthroughs of 2019. Noam received his PhD from Carnegie Mellon University.
